sym is a symmetrical sketchpad. I will refrain from listing use cases and functionality for the time being, I imagine it will be more fun to experience this way.

sym is heavily inspired by Devine Lu Linvega & Rekka Bellum's collection of small, sharp tools.
Indulge in their work [here (100rabbits)](https://100r.co), [here (XXIIVV)](https://wiki.xxiivv.com), and [here (kokorobot)](https://kokorobot.ca).
Huge thanks to them for the inspiration.
